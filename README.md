## Attributions

A special thank you to Brandon Mizutani and Tammy Do who helped me refactor and
troubleshoot for this lab. Brandon helped with the first portion for figuring
out to use .getText() method to help count the number of citations. Tammy
helped with the appending the citation.text to my results list in the second
portion of the lab.
